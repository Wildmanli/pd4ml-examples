A note is a string of text placed at the bottom of a page in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, 
volume or the whole text<pd4ml:footnote>In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column 
in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.</pd4ml:footnote>. 
The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or citations of a 
reference work in support of the text, or both.
<p>
Footnotes are notes at the foot of the page while endnotes<pd4ml:footnote>Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not 
affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back 
and forth between the main text and the endnotes.</pd4ml:footnote> are collected under a separate heading at 
the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.
